## Definition

Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, make it more 
readable, and reuse it.
The keyword `def` introduces a function definition. 
It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters (which can be empty). 
The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line and must be indented.


Functions only run when they are called. To call a function, use its name followed by parentheses:

```python
def my_function():  # function definition
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()  # function call
```

Read more about defining functions in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions">this section</a> of Python Documentation.
  
Define a function that can replace the duplicated `print` statements in the file.
